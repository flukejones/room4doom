# ROOM - Rusty Doom

## CORE/FEATURE FUNCTIONALITY

- [x] All gameplay features for Doom and Doom II
- [x] Status bar (face, health, armour, keys, ammo, cheats)
- [x] Powerup/damage palette effects
- [x] Thinkers for all things
- [-] HUD (Done except for multiplayer chat)
- [-] Menu screens (partial. New game, quit)
- [x] Play uncompresed ZDBSP maps (some textures may fail)
- [x] Intermissions and finale
  - [x] Stats
  - [x] Episode end text
  - [ ] Bunny screen
  - [ ] Doom II cast
- [ ] Automap
- [x] Demo playback
  - It works but accuracy is fucked due to movement system using floats not fixedpoint
- [ ] Save/load game
- [-] Sound:
  - [x] Verify positional sound
  - [x] Verify distance and cutoff
  - [x] Check the volumes (had to divide midi track vol in half)
  - [ ] Add the pitch shift
  - [ ] Maybe use the `usefulness` field..
  - [ ] OPL2 emulation (a lot of work here)
  - [ ] Load music from extra wads (needs `UMAPINFO` parsing)
- [x] CLI options (use `--help`)
- [x] Nuked Visplanes from orbit. Code is now much faster and cleaner

This is a personal project to rewrite Doom C in Rust. Where possible I try to keep the Doom behaviour intact, while also making some improvements. I am also trying to document everything as I go along.

I originally started by following along with [https://github.com/amroibrahim/DIYDoom](https://github.com/amroibrahim/DIYDoom)

Take a look at how [I progressed through](https://ljones.dev/blog/room4doom-20220529/)

Be warned that because the initial code is transliterated as much as possible from the Doom C except where that causes issues, many things may not be optimal or idiomatic rust. There will be things like dodgy casts, unrequired `as` casts, unused fields or args, lots of `unsafe` blocks etc. The main thing
I tried to do was bring up the game to a fully playable state _fast_, and _then_ begin to optimise, refactor, or redesign components - it is much easier to do when you have a working playable state to begin with that can be used for play-testing and such.

The code will dramatically change pver time.

1. Visplanes have been nuked. This gives quite a large speedup but is still not optimal due to extra math and nested array lookup
2. Demo playback was added. You will see the effects of the gameplay being in `f32` instead of fixedpoint.
3. The rendering is all `f32`. And it is a separate crate, so changing gameplay to fixedpoint would mean only a play position conversion for rendering, and rendering stays `f32`.

I may convert gameplay to fixedpoint.. I'm not sure. It'll be a huge amount of work and I'd have to add the tan/sin/cos tables or convert between radians and fixedpoint manually. Considering how little the gameplay actually does I can likely take some shortcuts.

Demos are disabled by default. Use the CLI opts `-E, --enable-demos` to enable them (does not save option). See `--help` for more options.

# 03/07/2024

You may notice a lot of `f32 as u32 as usize`. This is because a plain `as usize` results in:
```asm
cvttss2si       rax, xmm0
mov     rcx, rax
sar     rcx, 63
movaps  xmm1, xmm0
subss   xmm1, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_0]
cvttss2si       rdx, xmm1
and     rdx, rcx
or      rdx, rax
xor     ecx, ecx
xorps   xmm1, xmm1
ucomiss xmm0, xmm1
cmovae  rcx, rdx
ucomiss xmm0, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_1]
mov     rax, -1
cmovbe  rax, rcx
```

while `as u32 as usize`:
```asm
cvttss2si       rax, xmm0
xor     ecx, ecx
xorps   xmm1, xmm1
ucomiss xmm0, xmm1
cmovae  ecx, eax
ucomiss xmm0, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_0]
mov     eax, -1
cmovbe  eax, ecx
```
since on x64 the `usize` type is 64bits. Not a major thing, but interesting.

I use many `.get_unchecked(num)` on arrays I know are safe also, as this reduces instruction count from ~8 to 1.

## Goals

- To retain the classic Doom look with a software renderer
- To retain the classic Doom gameplay as much as possible
- Identify and split out individual systems as crates for easy changing
- Boom improvements compatibility

And maybe write a book on all I've learned about writing a Doom engine.

**Some of the improvements I've made (so far):**

- BSP used for collisions (Doom used the blockmap)
- BSP used for aiming, shooting, and LoS (Doom used the blockmap)
- Floats instead of fixed-point (this may cause slight behaviour changes)
- Basic surface shaders (ROOM renders to a surface that a shader can manipulate)
- Hi-Res and widescreen

## Building

I use and develop on Linux exclusively so although I once did a Windows build I don't maintain it.

- Distro SDL2: `cargo build`

The distro requires SDL2 + SDL2-mixer to be installed along with the related dev packages including `alsa-lib-devel` and `pulseaudio-libs-devel`.
Music support requires fluidsynth or timidity to be installed along with files in the `data/sound/`
being installed to `~/.local/share/room4doom/sound/`.

## User Config

On start a user config file is created at `~/.config/room4doom/user.toml`. This can be edited by hand.

Options set via CLI are saved to the user-config file.

Starting `room4doom` without CLI options _after_ previously setting options then exiting will load
those options (as saved to `~/.config/room4doom/user.toml`).

Use `room4doom --help` to see all available CLI options.

## Documentation

I've not been as good as I should be at this because I've been on a mad rush to implement
as much as I can. Plus the nature of doing large blocks hasn't helped. [misc/code-review/](./misc/code-review/)
has a semi-broken out series of files where I try to note things of interest, or even write
a full code review. Each of these files and additions will be updated and fleshed out over time.

The magnificance of rust/cargo being able to produce a static website full of code documentation
means that I try to maintain docs somewhat at [https://flukejones.gitlab.io/room4doom/room4doom/index.html](https://flukejones.gitlab.io/room4doom/room4doom/index.html).
Browsing [wad](https://flukejones.gitlab.io/room4doom/wad/index.html) is a good example of what I would like
to achieve here.
